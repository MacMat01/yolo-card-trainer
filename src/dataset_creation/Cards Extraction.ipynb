    "# Cards Extraction\n",
    "This notebook will guide you through the process of extracting cards from videos.\n",
    "The extracted cards will be used to create a dataset for training a YOLOv8 model to detect cards in images. \n",
    "The dataset will be used to train a model to detect cards in images.\n",
    "\n",
    "The process is as follows:\n",
    "1. Download the dataset of backgrounds from the Describable Textures Dataset (DTD).\n",
    "2. Extract the dataset and create a pickle file containing the images.\n",
    "3. Modify the `card_measures.py` file to adapt the measures of your cards.\n",
    "4. Modify the `global_variables.py` file to adapt your global variables.\n",
    "5. Record videos of each of your cards, using a green background and varying the lighting during the recording to have a more varied dataset.\n",
    "6. Extract the cards from the videos in the `data/video` folder.\n",
    "7. Modify the `data/card.names` file to suit your needs. It should contain all the names of your cards separated by a newline.\n",
